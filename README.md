# Steps to run this portfolio application

# Front-end

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In order to run the application in a local enviromnment, Node.js is required.

After cloning the directory to a local instance, it's necessary to run the following command to install all dependencies used by the app.

### `npm install`

After all dependencies are installed, it's possible to run the front-end app with the following command:

### `npm start`

# Back-end

There's a back-end endpoint for receiving the contact form info, and store it in a server created with json-server.

In order to run the server, it's necessary to run the following command:

### `json-server --watch db.json --port 4000`

After both servers are running, the app will be completely mounted.
